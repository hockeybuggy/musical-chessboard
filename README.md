==================

A toy project playing with midi in the browser

##TODO

- Automate the creation of the selects
    use the note preset array for the defauts.

- Change the shade by rank

- Change the colour of the side bar
    Make sections more clear
    Imply File is a subsection of Presets

- Add octave mapping by rank

- FIX a reset of the mapping requires a change to the form. This means that if
  you make a manual change and want to go back to the preset it does not go
  back to the 

- colour squares by sound. 
    Each of the 12 notes would get a colour.

- move rank and file outside of squares

- colour squares rather than text

- cut way down on the jquery... Like a lot...
