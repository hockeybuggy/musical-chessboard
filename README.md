==================

A toy project playing with midi in the browser

##TODO

- Automate the creation of the selects
    use the note preset array for the defauts.

- create mapping presets for sound
    German notation
    A squential scale of 8 notes

- colour squares by sound. 
    Each of the 12 notes would get a colour.

- move rank and file outside of squares
    colour squares rather than text

- cut way down on the jquery... Like a lot...
